# Accessories

Any single board computer relies on a host of accessories to make it useful in different markets. One aim of the 96Boards specification is to create a standard software and hardware platform across multiple SoCs for which a full range of accessories will be available and these will work across the boards. These products will be split into mezzanine products, which plug into the 96Boards high- and low-speed connectors to extend the board functionality, and everything else – from power supplies to UART solutions – which will be listed on this page. We’re working on a system that will enable users, manufacturers and distributors to post compatible products and then for users to review these and verify compatibility. Before that is ready, we are manually updating this page and you can make suggestions by emailing 96Boards@Linaro.org.

This section is for all USB devices that work on 96Boards. This will hopefully include USB Adapters, USB audio solutions, USB cameras and more… Note that we do not plan to list out USB hubs or USB mice and keyboards, but if there are particularly innovative solutions that we feel are worth listing, they may be listed here or in miscellaneous.

The 96Boards CE boards require an 8-18V 2A power supply.

We recommend a 12V 2A adapter with a DC plug that has a 4.75 mm outer diameter with 1.7mm center pin (EIAJ-3 Compliant).

Easiest way to prepare AC adapter for 96Boards is to have both bellow.

1. AC adapter which has 12V 2A DC output with DC plug has 5,5 diameter and 2.1 mm center pin. (Center pin positive)
2. DC plug converter from 5,5 diameter with 2.1 mm center pin to 4.75mm diameter with 1.7mm center pin.

Many lower cost boards use the ubiquitous microUSB cable to deliver 5V power. However, this limits the power capability to only 500mA at 5V by original official USB specification, which is less than 3W ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Power)). As more powerful SoCs become available, peak power requirements for the SoC alone can easily exceed 5W.

We therefore require an external power supply. In order to minimize the board height profile while maximizing the power available we specified to use an EIAJ-3 compliant DC plug available up to 2A, which is 4.75 mm outer diameter with 1.7mm center pin (4.75/1.7), for the power supply ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIAJ_connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIAJ_connector)). For an embedded product, power can alternatively be provided over the low speed expansion bus. (Note: this paragraph has been extracted from the [96Boards Specification](http://96boards.local/specifications/).)

Other types of DC plug commonly used have a 5.5 mm outer diameter with 2.1mm center pin (5.5/2.1).

This page lists out powers supplies with both 4.75/1.7 and 5.5/2.1 connectors plus some 5.5/2.1 to 4.75/1.7 converters that are required if you have a 5.5/2.1 power supply.

The below is more detailed information about selecting the correct DC plug and jack for 96Boards.

There are three commonly used DC plug/jack in most consumer products.

1.  Outer diameter 5.5mm and a 2.1mm center barrel (5.5/2.1)
2.  Outer diameter 5.5mm and a 2.5mm center barrel (5.5/2.5)
3.  Outer diameter 4.75mm and a 1.7mm center barrel (4.75/1.7 EIAJ-3 compliant)

And also there are two type of each, (a) center pin positive and (b) center pin negative. The center negative is commonly considered not a good practice but some products uses outer shield for 5V or 12V and the center pin for ground, while most of the AC adapters are opposite, the outer shield is ground and the center pin is 5V or 12V. If you plug the AC adapter with center negative which has outer positive to the 96boards, it will burn out the 96boards products.

There is an EIAJ-2 plug that has an outer diameter of 4.75mm and a 1.7mm center barrel (4.0/1.7). The 4.0/1.7 EIAJ-2 plug is able to insert into 4.75/1.7 EIAJ-3, but it will cause the outer shield to have weak connection and make the board unstable.

Also, the 5.5/2.5 DC plug is able to insert to 5.5/2.1 jack on 5.5/2.1 to 4.75/1.7 converters but it will have weak center pin connection and make the 96Boards unstable.

In the 96boards specification, it uses 4.75/1.7 EIAJ-3 and center pin positive.

We strongly advise to check your plug is correct as follows:

1.  Use DC plug has 4.75/1.7 EIAJ-3.
2.  Or use plug converter from 5.5/2.1 to 4.75/1.7 EIAJ-3 plug.
3.  Make sure the polarity is center pin positive.

# Arrow Audio Mezzanine

This Audio Mezzanine Board is a Grove interfaced expansion board intended for 96boards.
You can connect 96Boards to various modules easily with this expansion board. There are six
grove ports which can be used to connect rich Grove functional modules, which will make your
application more complicated and attracting. In addition, this expansion board gets one 3.5 mm
audio port and two independent MICs which can be applied into multimedia processing. Since
96Boards I/O voltage is set at 1.8 V, so it cannot be connected directly to embedded world. This
expansion board has used voltage converting circuit so that you can choose 3.3V/5V as the
output voltage. Other features are also embedded on this expansion board such as USB to
Serial circuit and reset button, and so on, all those make 96Boards more conveniently to build
applications.

# Grove Seeed Sensor Mezzanine

The 96Boards Sensors Mezzanine adapter makes it simple and easy to connect sensors and devices to any 96Boards-compatible base board. With it you can connect your favourite Grove modules and Arduino compatible shields and interface to software running
on the 96Boards baseboard. It provides everything you need to start experimenting and prototyping on the 96Boards platform.

On the board you will find sockets for 18 Grove modules, an Arduino-compatible shield socket, and two SPI headers. It also includes an ATMega328 microcontroller which can be programmed from the Arduino IDE and will run most Arduino UNO sketches
unchanged. The shield connector and half of the Grove sockets are controlled by the microcontroller, while the remaining Grove sockets are controlled directly by the baseboard. This makes it a flexible prototyping platform which supports both direct
control of devices from application software, and offload to a microcontroller. It also provides a USB-UART interface to access the base board’s serial console.

# UART Serial Mezzanine

Available now from Seeed: This adapter is a USB to UART interface to be used with any base board compatible with the 96Boards Consumer Edition or Enterprise Edition specifications.

It makes it easy to connect your PC to the serial console on the 96Boards low-speed expansion connector, without worrying about pinout or level shifting for 1.8V IO. It also provides remote control of the power button and reset signals so that the base board can be completely controlled over a single USB cable.

Since it uses the FT230X chip from FTDI, when it is connected to your PC over USB, it appears as a normal UART interface on a PC, Macintosh or Linux computer with an FTDI UART driver installed.
